			I'm Daniel, a Full-Stack Software Developer passionate about Open-Source, Linux and Music ðŸŽœ. I
			believe that through the creation of apps, we deliver experiences that empower users to change

			My journey as a Developer began in 2015 when I was trying to start a little business; back
			then, we needed a website and had no knowledge of creating one. Sure, we could make use of
			some developer-free tooling, but Nah, I wanted to make something highly customizable to fit in
			perfection the idea we had, so I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

			Little did I know that from that day on, I would fall in love and keep digging into a
			neverending hole of knowledge and challenges.
