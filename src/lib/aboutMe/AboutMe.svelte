			I'm Daniel, a Full-Stack Software Developer passionate about Open-Source, Linux and Music
			&#9835;. I believe that through the creation of apps, we deliver experiences that empower
			users to change how they interact with their lives, so by the same principle, I want to
			deliver the bests experiences I can give.

			My journey as a Developer began in 2015 when I was trying to start a little business; back
			then, we needed a website and had no knowledge of creating one. Sure, we could make use of
			some developer-free tooling, but Nah, I wanted to make something highly customizable to fit in
			perfection the idea we had, so I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify text-base text-slate-200 sm:text-xl">
			Little did I know that from that day on, I would fall in love and keep digging into a
			neverending hole of knowledge and challenges.
